        <span  class="poem1">
            Beneath his stern visage, there was still a light in his eyes,<br> 
            becoming dimmed by circumstances seemingly beyond his control -<br> 
            he wore a Fedora with a black band of velvet, something soft<br> 
            to soothe his tumbling thoughts, perhaps. On those few days

                Dawn peeks over the horizon after Summer's night<br> 
                and feels the early stillness of grass laden with dew,<br> 
                and songbirds on green steps to heaven<br> 
                that brush a rippling mirror.<br> 
                The bluebird sings summer, but then<br> 
                a whisper of wind swings down from a frosty sky<br> 
                and rushes through tall swamp grasses<br> 
                that cling together at the coolness.<br> 
                A flutter of wings fill a pine<br> 
                as the songbirds spring in surprise<br> 
                and silence their song at beginning notes<br> 
                that follow the whispering wind,<br> 
                and the wind wakes the oak from it's daze<br> 
                and green answers the call and leaves in the waves<br> 
                and Fall whispers, "Come".

            He gives her her skin<br> 
            He just seemed to pull it down out of the air and lay it over her<br> 
            She weeps with fearfulness and astonishment<br> 
            <br>
            She has found his hands for him, and fitted them freshly at the wrists<br> 
            They are amazed at themselves, they go feeling all over her<br>

                dew drops of rain drip from brows<br>

                thrown down on dread head<br>

                that join companions<br> 
                far ahead down below<br> 
                rushing to a much too distant cup<br> 
                rejoicing being filled<br> 
                from so far away away away<br> 
                down yonder way over yonder<br> 
                as i skip very nearly a jump into puddles<br>
